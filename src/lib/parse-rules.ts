// Custom OC Rules PDF parser (Gemini 2.5 Pro).
//
// Input: a PDF of registered owners-corporation rules. Output: a flat list of
// numbered rules, each scoped to one of the OCs the document covers, with the
// rule's heading, the parent-section heading, body text, page number, and an
// optional bounding box.
//
// Multi-OC PDFs are common: a single plan of subdivision can register rules
// for BOTH the residential apartment OC and a separate commercial OC. The old
// schema merged them into one flat list, producing duplicate rule numbers
// across OCs (e.g. two "1.1.1"s with totally different content). Each rule
// now carries an `oc_scope` so the consumer can group by OC.
//
// Parent-section heading: rules like "8.2.1 Advertising Signage" sit under a
// top-level chapter "8. Commercial Lots". The chapter heading carries
// load-bearing context (without it you can't tell 8.2.1 is a commercial-lot
// rule). `parent_heading` retains that string so it can be rendered above
// the rule in viewer.

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You extract every numbered rule from a registered Victorian Owners Corporation rules PDF.

Multi-OC documents:
- A single PDF can register rules for more than one OC (typical for mixed-use plans of subdivision where the residential and commercial OCs share a document). Detect EVERY distinct OC the document covers and list them in oc_scopes.
- Every rule MUST carry an oc_scope matching one of the labels in oc_scopes. If the document only defines rules for one OC, all rules share the same scope. Do NOT merge two OCs into a single rule list.
- A typical signal of an OC boundary is a heading like "Owners Corporation 1 — Rules", "Owners Corporation No. 2", a page break followed by a section reset back to "1.1.1", or an explicit "Special Rules for OC2" header.

Hierarchy (chapter → section → rule):
- Australian OC rules documents are typically three-tiered: a CHAPTER number with a heading (bold, e.g. "1. Health Safety and Security"), inside it a SECTION number with a heading (italic / indented, e.g. "1.1. General"), and inside that the actual numbered RULES (e.g. "1.1.1. An owner or occupier...").
- For EVERY rule, populate:
    chapter_number   = the leading integer of rule_number ("1" for "1.1.1", "8" for "8.2.1"). Verbatim, no trailing period.
    chapter_heading  = the chapter's heading text without the number ("Health Safety and Security", "Commercial Lots").
    section_number   = the two-level dotted prefix ("1.1" for "1.1.1", "8.2" for "8.2.1"). Null only if the document jumps straight from chapter to rule with no middle tier.
    section_heading  = the section heading text without the number ("General", "Advertising Signage"). Null if section_number is null.
- Also set parent_heading to a combined string ("1. Health Safety and Security — 1.1 General") for backwards compatibility with older consumers.
- When a numbered entry IS itself a chapter heading (e.g. the line is just "8. Commercial Lots" with no body text), emit it with section_number=null and rule_number = chapter_number, body = chapter_heading.

Rule mechanics:
- Return every rule the document defines, in source order.
- Preserve sub-numbering verbatim (e.g. "2.3.a" stays "2.3.a", NOT "2.3.1").
- Body text should be the full text of the rule, joined into one string. Drop only the leading rule number / rule's own heading.
- Use page_number to indicate where each rule starts (1-indexed).

Document-type gate:
- BEFORE extracting anything, decide whether this PDF actually IS a set of OC rules.
- If it's something else (plan of subdivision, insurance cert, levy notice, photo, contract, blank page, garbled OCR), set is_oc_rules=false, document_type_guess to your best one-line description, oc_scopes=[], and return rules=[].
- When in doubt return false. The manager can re-upload.`;
