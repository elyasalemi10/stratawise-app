// ============================================================================
// Refresh bar + stale-while-revalidate.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every data page here works the same way: arriving at a page you have been
// to before renders the last data instantly out of the client router cache
// (see experimental.staleTimes in next.config.ts), then quietly fetches the
// current version behind it.
//
// That leaves one honest question unanswered: is what I'm looking at current?
// Without an answer you get one of two bad outcomes, a blank loading wall on
// every revisit, or silently stale numbers with no hint they're being checked.
//
// The bar is the answer. It means "this is your last data, and I'm fetching
// the latest right now."
//
// THE BAR DOES NOT TRACK NAVIGATION. An earlier version hooked link clicks
// and history.pushState and ran the bar from navigation start to finish,
// which made the bar look like a thing you had to wait out before the page
// arrived. Navigation is instant and shows cached data; the bar is only ever
// a caveat on data already on screen.
//
// Three states a page can be in, and only one gets the bar:
//
//   1. Nothing cached      first ever visit. No bar , loading.tsx skeletons
//                          instead, because there is nothing on screen to
//                          caveat. Bar and skeletons are mutually exclusive:
//                          a page shimmering AND claiming to refresh
//                          describes nothing.
//   2. Arriving with cache bar shows until the fetch lands. THE ONLY CASE.
//   3. Background poll     no bar. Pages re-fetch every 30s, and again when
//                          the tab regains focus. A light flashing across
//                          the screen twice a minute while you work reads as
//                          an alarm, and you would learn to ignore it , at
//                          which point it is worth nothing when it matters.
//
// The rule is that the bar answers a question you are actually asking. You
// ask it on arrival. You don't ask it every thirty seconds while typing.
//
// Mounted once in the root layout , don't render it per-page.
